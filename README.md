# Instructions on running the application

Currently there exists no user interface for the application.

However the main.py file requires inputs from the terminal. Thus run

__python main.py__ on your terminal.

Upon running it will require the first input, this is the amount...i.e 70

__press enter__

The next input is the phone number to make request from i.e 254700000000

__press enter__

Check your mobile phone for the request. __DO NOT ENTER YOUR PIN__

Cancel the request.


# Specifications

This code will work with any app provided amount and phone number are sent to the api url. It will also send responses to set urls in the env file.

You can connect this said url to a bulk messaging provider which will then maybe push custom messages to your clients.
